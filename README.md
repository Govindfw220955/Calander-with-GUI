Project#2 Using Tkinter to Build GUI Calendar
In this project, we have tried to design a GUI (Graphical User Interface) application of Calendar. You will see when the code will run and window will popup and you can see the current date on that window.
You can easily find your desired date/month and year according to your requirement.
